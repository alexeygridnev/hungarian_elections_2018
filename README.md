# hungarian_elections_2018
Scripts for scraping results of Hungarian parliamentary elections of 2018 and 2010 elections. So far, scrapes only results for proportional representation for 2018 elections (for all parties) and for multimember constituencies for 2010 elections(for Fidesz, Jobbik, MSzP and LMP). Written for a research paper which was presented in UPTAKE Workshop in Tartu on 19 October 2018 (http://www.uptake.ut.ee/cfp-uptake-workshop-democracy-in-reverse-at-tartu-estonia/) To be updated.
